# SAAS - String As A Service
An amazing application that takes numbers as input and spits out strings as output


**Example:**

Input: 42

Output: "42"

Decimals are not supported


---


Run it:

```docker run -p 8000:8000 hscasn/saas_stringasaservice```


Then test it:

```localhost:8000/?number=42```

Alternatively, try using the yaml in the deployment directory for deploying with Kubernetes

...or not. Up to you!
