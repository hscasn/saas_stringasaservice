# SAAS - String As A Service
An amazing application that takes input and spits out output


Run it:

docker run -p 8000:8000 hscasn/saas_stringasaservice


Then test it:

localhost:8000/?number=42

Alternatively, try using the yaml in the deployment directory for deploying with Kubernetes

...or not. Up to you!
